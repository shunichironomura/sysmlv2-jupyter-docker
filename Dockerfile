## Copy all notebooks into the docker image. Move them into a notebooks
## subdirectory so that nbviewer + mybinder can work together.
RUN mkdir notebooks

## This only makes sense in the `make spin-up` environment, i.e. locally
RUN rm notebooks/*/StartHere.ipynb

## Trust the notebooks so that the SVG images will be displayed.
RUN find . -name \*.ipynb -exec jupyter trust \{\} \;
